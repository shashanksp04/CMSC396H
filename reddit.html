        <h2 id=Title>Title: Summer/Fall 2018 Course Registration Megathread</h2>
        <h2 id=Text>Content of the post</h2> Hello all,
        
        Sorry for the lateness of this thread, but this is now the place to post all questions/comments/concerns about any course you may be thinking about signing up for this coming year. This is necessary to clean up the subreddit a little bit, so we'll see how it does.
        
        From here on out, any new post about a specific class (questions about professors, workload, waitlisting, withdrawing, etc.) will be redirected to this thread and removed to try to reduce the clutter around here. 
        
        Also be sure to check in to answer any of your fellow Terps' questions about classes you may have taken already, give some feedback, share any experience (positive or negative) etc. Any knowledge you have is valuable.
        
        &nbsp;
        
        Thanks all, good luck with exams and scheduling!
        
        &nbsp;

        <br>Top Upvoted Comment 1: CMSC451: 
        I searched through this subreddit and couldn't find any fresh information on this class and professor.
        
        Anyone currently in this class, is it worth taking it with Childs, or is better to wait for Mount?
        
        I struggled through 250 and 351 (C's in both) but heard that this class is tremendously useful for interviews and such. If I'm terrible with proofs, but have a good intuition towards designing algorithms, can I make it through this class?  I'm also interested in how harshly exams/assignments are graded.
        
        I want to get better at this stuff, but don't want to sacrifice what little I have of my GPA in a futile attempt. Thanks for reading.

        It has a lab in the course, so is this considered a Natural science with lab?

        **What are my options for summer housing and beyond?**
        
        Well for the summer you will have options to sublease in Commons/Courtyards, the View and Varsity, CP Towers, or another off campus housing option. Each of these will have different prices and amenities so you should look at their websites. Check out [Off Campus Housing Services](https://och.umd.edu/) for more info.

        <br>Top Upvoted Comment 2: I am a rising junior and I got denied on-campus housing even though I applied 1 week before the deadline. What is the best option for me now because I live very far from campus, so I cannot commute. If I should look at housing outside of UMD then where can I look because I cannot afford apartments near UMD? Thanks.

        <br>Top Downvoted Comment 1: I am looking at cheap rooms in houses off-campus. Is $675 (utilites included) for a place around the distance to CP Woods a good price? Or, is it actually reasonable to get somewhere for substantially cheaper? 
        
        I sort of want to get my housing settled already, and I'm really not familiar with house prices, but this is so much better than nearby apartments that I'm glad to walk to the shuttle stop at courtyards or take the long walk/bike to campus.

        <br>Top Downvoted Comment 2: hey all, I'm a rising sophomore (f) and I'm in a group of 4 for now but we might add some ppl later if there are no 4 person suites left. not the greatest option but if you end up having no other plans, you can always reach out and if we do end up going that route we'll have 1 or 2 open spots in our group.

        <h2 id=Title>Title: New course PHYS 360 for the Fall?</h2>
        <h2 id=Text>Content of the post</h2> Hi,
        
        I was wondering if anyone happened to know anything about this [PHYS 360](https://app.testudo.umd.edu/soc/search?courseId=PHYS360&sectionId=&termId=202408&_openSectionsOnly=on&creditCompare=%3E%3D&credits=0.0&courseLevelFilter=ALL&instructor=&_facetoface=on&_blended=on&_online=on&courseStartCompare=&courseStartHour=&courseStartMin=&courseStartAM=&courseEndHour=&courseEndMin=&courseEndAM=&teachingCenter=ALL&_classDay1=on&_classDay2=on&_classDay3=on&_classDay4=on&_classDay5=on) course listed for the Fall. I haven't seen this course and can't find anything on it, is it new? Would this be worth taking if I plan to take CMSC 457 in the Spring, which requires a strong linear algebra background by itself (granted I'd have physics background up to waves & modern physics...)?

        <h2 id=Title>Title: Upper Level Bio Classes (Spring/Summer)?</h2>
        <h2 id=Text>Content of the post</h2> Any easy/fun upper level biology classes offered in the Spring or Summer? Only problem is I have not taken BSCI330, which is a prerequisite for a lot of chill upper level courses like BSCI433 and BSCI420. Preferably something in evolution, ecology, behavior, or organismal biology, since those are my favorites. But I'm comfortable in most biology courses!
        
        I have credit for BSCI 160/161, BSCI 170/171, and have taken BSCI222, BSCI370, BSCI467, and BSCI334/335. I'm enrolled in BSCI341 for next semester and plan on taking BSCI400 in Fall 2025. I also plan on taking BSCI392/393 for my minor in Spring 2025.

        <h2 id=Title>Title: CS students: How to get a math double major without taking any additional courses</h2>
        <h2 id=Text>Content of the post</h2> I'm a CS/Math double masochist who has stared deep into the forbidden knowledge of testudo.umd.edu in order to minmax my schedule, and now that I'm planning senior year I feel it is time to share the dark witchcraft I have invoked to get to this point so that others of similar (in)sanity may follow.
        
        First things first, you will need to be able to tolerate and pass upper-level math courses. This is not a guide on how to avoid taking them altogether. Also, I came into college with a fair amount of credits/AP test exemptions, but there's room in this plan even if you didn't.
        
        I'll be listing requirements followed by what class I took to fill them. Let's start by looking at the CS general-track degree requirements, found here and here:
        
        [https://undergrad.cs.umd.edu/degree-requirements-cs-major](https://undergrad.cs.umd.edu/degree-requirements-cs-major)
        
        [https://undergrad.cs.umd.edu/general-track-degree-requirements](https://undergrad.cs.umd.edu/general-track-degree-requirements)
        
        &#x200B;
        
        Math requirements:
        
        MATH140 - AP Test
        
        MATH141 - AP Test
        
        STAT4XX - STAT410
        
        MATH/STATXXX - MATH241 or MATH246
        
        &#x200B;
        
        CS requirements:
        
        CMSC131/133 - AP Test
        
        CMSC132 - CMSC132
        
        CMSC216 - CMSC216
        
        CMSC250 - CMSC250 (try to get a B or higher, you'll see why later)
        
        CMSC330 - CMSC330
        
        CMSC351 - CMSC351
        
        &#x200B;
        
        Upper Level Concentration:
        
        MATH403
        
        MATH405
        
        MATH410
        
        MATH430
        
        &#x200B;
        
        Degree Requirements:
        
        CMSC460 (HAS TO be this class or maybe CMSC466)
        
        CMSC426 (can be another class)
        
        CMSC427 (can be another class)
        
        CMSC451 (can be another class)
        
        CMSC474 (can be another class)
        
        &#x200B;
        
        Degree Electives:
        
        CMSC425 (can be another class)
        
        CMSC475 (HAS TO be this class) (Edit: Can also probably be replaced with CMSC456 as pointed out by sggesttut, or any other crosslisted CMSC/MATH 400-level course. Always ask your advisor to confirm that any crosslisted course counts towards both majors.)
        
        &#x200B;
        
        IMPORTANT: You need a B- or higher in MATH410, as well as a B- or higher in at least three of the following: STAT410, CMSC460/466, MATH403, MATH405, MATH430. You'll see why later. Also, for courses I have listed as "can be another class", at least two of them must have MATH141 as a prerequisite (CMSC426 and CMSC427 in my case).
        
        &#x200B;
        
        So that's the CS degree done. Guess what? The math major is ALSO filled by this plan. To prove it, let's look at the math (traditional track) major requirements, found here:
        
        [https://www-math.umd.edu/course-requirements.html](https://www-math.umd.edu/course-requirements.html)
        
        &#x200B;
        
        Introductory sequence:
        
        MATH140 - AP Test
        
        MATH141 - AP Test
        
        MATH240 - Actually I lied, I took MATH240 and you probably will have to too.
        
        MATH241 - MATH241 (I filled with Calc III I took at community college senior year of high school)
        
        MATH246 - MATH246
        
        (you can try to find ways out of having to take 240/241/246, like AP tests, exemption exams, community college credit (Calc III), or higher-level replacements, but be careful that all other requirements are still filled)
        
        &#x200B;
        
        Math310:
        
        As stated here: [https://www-math.umd.edu/planning-your-courses.html#:\~:text=exempted%20from%20MATH310](https://www-math.umd.edu/planning-your-courses.html#:~:text=exempted%20from%20MATH310)
        
        you are exempt if you earn certain grades in other classes. The easiest is probably getting a B in CMSC250.
        
        &#x200B;
        
        One course from blah blah blah, it's filled by CMSC131 or 132 or something.
        
        &#x200B;
        
        Three-course sequence:
        
        CMSC131, CMSC132, CMSC216
        
        &#x200B;
        
        Okay, now the crazy part is the 8 required 400-level math courses.
        
        1. MATH401 or 403 or 405 - MATH403 (or MATH405)
        2. AMSC460/466 - CMSC460 or maybe CMSC466 (these are crosslisted between AMSC and CMSC)
        3. MATH410 - MATH410
        4. One-year sequence - MATH403 and MATH405 (you can probably do any sequence you want but this is the one I did)
        5. STAT4XX - STAT410The rest are less specific requirements:
        6. MATH430
        7. CMSC475 (is crosslisted with MATH475) (Can also probably be replaced with CMSC456 as pointed out by sggesttut, or any other crosslisted CMSC/MATH 400-level course. Always ask your advisor to confirm that any crosslisted course counts towards both majors.)
        8. This is where the stuff I talked about earlier comes in. As a direct quote from my advisor, "For students who are in the TRADITIONAL track, if they do well in their upper-level math courses (4 courses of at least a B-, one of which is MATH410), then they may replace one of their upper-level math electives with two 400-level courses that have high math content (with MATH141 as prerequisite)."
        
        And that's it. That's a whole second math major done with just the requirements for the CS major (plus MATH240 and maybe MATH241 and MATH246 because I'm a dirty liar; still no extra upper-levels though).
        
        Things to keep in mind: Please do your own research on this. These things may change over time and you may need to take a different route here. Talk to your advisor and make sure you're filling all the requirements you need to. Do degree audits to check as well. If you come in with AP tests scores or community college credit, make sure it's filling what you expect it to. You should have plenty of room in this schedule if you need to take more classes than I did (I did this while also taking an astronomy minor and being in a 4-year honors college. Masochist, remember?). If you come in with enough credits and/or take enough at UMD you can turn this into a double degree instead of just a double major (I believe the only difference in requirements is the number of credits you have when you graduate) (EDIT: As TheCrowWhisperer3004 pointed out, for a double degree (not a double major) "Each major must contain at least 18 unique semester hours not contained in the other." So it may actually not be possible to get a double degree using this plan, idk.) Somewhat unrelated, but check to make sure you're getting all your gen-ed requirements filled.
        
        I may have forgotten things here, don't be scared to ask (though I'm not sure how long it may take me to reply). If you find any issues with this or have questions about it please let me know.

        For a minor "No more than six credits (or two courses) may be applied to satisfy both the requirements of a minor and a major program."
        
        No rule like that for majors?

        <h2 id=Title>Title: How can I aim to get a higher GPA as I progress through upper level CS courses?</h2>
        <h2 id=Text>Content of the post</h2> I’m currently a sophomore with a 2.9 GPA. I just completed cmsc250 & 216 with a B- and a C respectively, and while I do fine completing projects and the like, I perform consistently below average on exams. 
        
        Although I’ve been getting better grades than 131/132, as I had no prior coding experience and had C- for both, I am wondering if it’s possible to get a 3.0+ as I progress to 330/351, and 400-level classes.
        
        Of course, in theory it is possible, I just wanted to know if anyone has been in a similar situation as I and still improved throughout difficult classes I will have to face in my next 2.5 years of my degree.
        
        I’m just worried that because of my poor GPA I have no chance for internships/new grad opportunities.

        <br>Top Upvoted Comment 1: Honestly, if you're at a 2.9, youre doing okay, theres nothing to stress over. I have a lower gpa, and still got faang internships.
        
        if you want to do well in a class, start going to office hours regularly. Study groups also help. Those are the 2 habits that all of my 4.0 friends share.
        <span id=number>The comment has 48 upvotes</span>
        <br>Top Upvoted Comment 2: Tips from /u/aflac4 and /u/GO_Zark are spot on. Those practices would be a nice foundation on which to build. Said another way, you need to get into the field, not be a spectator, and by this we mean become part of community, think about the stuff more than to check boxes for assignments and pay attention to developments. 
        
        Before tossing in other tips, let me politely dissent from the assertion that at 2.9 you're okay. Umm, no. You're not. Maybe that is technically adequate to rack up credits to get a degree (it won't be after the new standards kick in next fall) but it is not adequate to thrive in the field. It shows there is a lot of content you are simply not retaining, and I am very confident that there is little content here that the dept tossed in just for grins. It is all there for a reason. The real goal is to think effectively like a computing scientist and so are prepared to thrive in a career, but as a secondary matter, this is reflected in better GPA, which can't hurt in the market. 
        
        The extra tips (which I think dovetail nicely with those already mentioned): First, learn how to learn. This is not the trivial tip it might sound like. Different material is presented to reach different learning objectives, and not all material is best-studied the same way. We all picked up study practices in high school where, probably, teachers promoted a one-size-fits-all approach just to keep overhead low. Friend, if you are deciding about note taking or study routines without first knowing the instructor's intended learning objectives, then you are trying to navigate without any map. Eventually you might bump into your destination but Good Lord can that be an expensive trip, which also reinforces some of the wrong content along the way. Instructors often are explicit about goals and tips for best methods, and if not then ASK THEM. (Oh. Like during office hours, an excuse to build a good relationship so you get tips, mentoring and consideration later....) If you are wondering how other students seem to get the grades without breaking a sweat then often it is that they figured out how to study effectively. All this is the stuff of a longer conversation with your faculty mentor. Do it!
        
        Another: when it comes to projects, drill, baby, drill. The goal isn't to hackslash through to get some ostensibly working program you can throw over the wall. It is to understand concepts in operational ways and reflect on how those new concepts relate to what is already in your head. If you aren't taking time to articulate those concepts, you miss full value. If you aren't doing the full drill (and then some) as requested by the instructor, you miss full value. (Yeah, there are plenty of tools out there to streamline generation of one or another solution. Don't do that. You're just leveraging the fact that someone else figured out how to accomplish some step efficiently, that doesn't mean you know it. And this comes out in basic ways too. If I taught intro classes then I would ban use of some of these frameworks and dev tools. Wow, what a great way they are to deny someone the opportunity to build a strong mental model of what is going on under the hood.) 
        
        Learn serious dev skills. No, I am not talking about l33t code, I am talking about the moment to moment operations that someone who knows his craft will perform in solving a problem. We mostly don't see this illustrated in classes here, mostly since they are not taught by people who ever had to support themselves as such. But the way one thinks about a problem to code a solution approach, confirm intermediate states, localize faults when they are manifest, recognize the right steps to repair errors, and more ... these are real and important skills. Find a faculty mentor who knows this stuff (or at least gravitate to apropriate professorial faculty when you register for courses) and pick up these practices. They will so spectacularly pay off in both course projects and career. I am always shocked to bump into a graduating senior who has never even seen the basics. No wonder they struggled to get through - they had to work hard since nobody ever shared with them how to work smart.

        Summer and winter courses. 
        
        If you take 1 gen ed during a summer semester and get an A in it, it will be considered as if you got a 4.0 for a semester and will be averaged with a previous semester. So theoretically, you get a 3.0 your first semester, a 4.0 you winter semester, you have a 3.5 GPA. Someone feel free to correct me.

        <h2 id=Title>Title: Trying to drop a GenEd course for a W, going from 14 credits to 11. What will happen?</h2>
        <h2 id=Text>Content of the post</h2> I want to drop a GenEd because it’s going to kill my GPA and I dislike the professor heavily. If I drop a class now and become part time, will I get charged part time tuition, and is that more expensive than 12+ credits in any way? The website states:
        
        “After day five of schedule adjustment through the end of schedule adjustment: If a full-time undergraduate drops a course or courses thereby changing the total number of credits for which the student is registered to 11 or less, charges for the semester will be assessed on the basis of part-time per credit hour tuition plus 20% of the difference between the full-time tuition and fees and appropriate part-time charges.”
        
        Are we still in the schedule adjustment period still? I am not sure why but I have a hard time deciphering what this passage above means.  
        
        I don’t have financial aid or health insurance where courseload matters. Housing, dining plans, etc aren’t affected I believe.

        <br>Top Upvoted Comment 1: No, the Schedule Adjustment is over - they are the first 10 business days of the semester (standard term). so there wouldn’t be a financial penalty. You just wouldn’t get a refund for the dropped course and you would get a grade mark of “W.”

If there are none, you are better off with a W, and then, with a grade that is going to pull down your GPA.

        <h2 id=Title>Title: Question about Double Major with CS + Math</h2>
        <h2 id=Text>Content of the post</h2> I'm coming in with some credits (54 credits), and 131, 132, and 250 exemption exams along with all math courses up until and including MATH241 cleared by CBE/APs.
        
        I'm interested in CS + Math, but also really like finance -- so I want to do the Computational Finance Minor (looks really fun but also hard), so I also added that to my "college plan" schedule (rough screenshot of it is attached). Goal is to get CS + Math + Computational Finance within 3 years (not a strict goal, just goal is to enjoy college and get some good pieces of paper and get out when I need).
        
        OK SO MY QUESTION:
        
        Is it possible to do a DOUBLE DEGREE (not dual major) along with a minor like CompFin with only 133 credits or so... is it even possible to do a double degree with a minor?
        
        Is it worth it (for someone who isn't into research + PhD shit as of now) to really care about the distinction between double degrees and dual majors?
        
        NOTE: I'm only planning this bc I have a 3-6am shift as CA so I'm pretty bored -- I'm VERY FULL AWARE this schedule is what I'm planning now not having taken ANY classes at UMD. It can (and ngl probably will) change -- I just want to see if ppl could comment on it. don't talk about how difficult BUFN400 and BFUN401 are im pretty well aware as of now
        
        Any Math or CS course I've picked is either bc it's required, or bc I have checked on Reddit and Testudo that I'm interested and want to do it (at least as of now).

        <br>Top Upvoted Comment 1: You need 150 credits for a double degree (but you can still get a double major). There is virtually no difference between the two.
        
        Some things in your schedule won’t work like cmsc422 at the same time as cmsc330/351.
        
        Tbh what you should do is write down all the required classes you need to take for both majors and minor and then kinda check them off/Tetris them together.

        <br>Top Downvoted Comment 2: First I would definitely not take 403 or 405 spring 2024. They are hard proof classes and not suggested to be taken before 410, as well as with these other very difficult comp sci courses. Next you may need a year sequence depending on your track so you'll have to add 411, or 463, or take stat410 instead of 400 and then add 420.

        <h2 id=Title>Title: How does everyone feel about the upcoming CS LEP course requirements?</h2>
        <h2 id=Text>Content of the post</h2> For anyone who doesn't know, the [Computer Science LEP requirements](https://lep.umd.edu/computerscience-after2024.html) are going to change starting the Fall 2024 semester. TL;DR:
        
        * Instead of a C- or above required for the gateway courses (CMSC131, CMSC132, MATH140), you will need a B- or above.
        * Instead of a 2.7 cumulative minimum GPA, you will need a 3.0 cumulative minimum GPA.
        * Finally, instead of all applying students being guaranteed admission, students will undergo a selective review process where not all students will be admitted. The webpage states:
        
        >Meeting the Gateway course grade and GPA requirements does not guarantee admission to the major. Academic record, co-curricular involvement, computing-related research experience or personal projects, and UMD honors and awards are considered in the admission decision.
        
        What does everyone think about this new change? Personally, I'm a little conflicted, but I can only assume that this was done to combat the increasing amount of CS applicants.

        <br>Top Upvoted Comment 2: The course requirements make total sense, I’d highly doubt the success of anyone in CS if they get below a B- in the introductory CS courses. CS is also effectively an applied math degree, so requiring a B- in Calc 1 makes sense.
        
        I do worry a bit about the other half though — seems like it could favor people who popped out of the womb coding in java and those who didn’t have the time to do extracirricular coding due to lack of resources or factors out of their control. It would be nice to see a high GPA bypassing that, like it does in business

        <br>Top Downvoted Comment 1: Don't really mess with it because some ppl don't know what they want to do in college, hence the whole reason for LTSC especially it being their first time in college classes. (Lol they just need better faculty imo) But yeah I see why they are doing it, so to each their own. Def will have an effect on people going here or not for cs or switching majors. It is what is but curious how this will turn out in the upcoming years.

        <br>Top Downvoted Comment 2: Honestly this was a long time coming, the current gateway requirements are quite honestly extremely easy. Especially with how well the undergraduate program places and how absurdly large the classes are getting, it was bound to happen eventually. I have heard that they are making it easier to get into CS as a direct admit though, to counteract some of this

        <h2 id=Title>Title: UMD Physics Courses (PHYS 274 vs. 373)</h2>
        <h2 id=Text>Content of the post</h2> Hi, I'm an admitted Freshman for Fall 2024 under CS and I am interested in doing a minor in physics. I'm transferring in credits for PHYS 161 and PHYS 260 (general physics I and II, so basically what AP physics C gets you, except they're from community college). I wanted to take PHYS 273 (introductory physics III) during my first semester, along with PHYS 274 (math methods I). However, it doesn't seem that math methods I is offered this fall, so I was thinking I could take math methods II if I were to get exempt. I'm transferring in community college credits for MATH 240, 241, and 246 and I've heard those are the main topics that PHYS 274 covers, so I'm wondering if I already have the knowledge that the course would offer me.
        
        If anyone has taken these classes before, would you suggest that taking PHYS 373 along with PHYS 273 my first semester be doable? I won't be taking PDE or complex analysis simultaneously, but is that a necessity for the class?

        <br>Top Downvoted Comment 1: Talking with a physics advisor is your best bet, but my understanding is that the new math course, MATH243, will replace PHYS274. The course description says MATH243 is lin alg and diff eq. Your MATH240 and MATH246 courses probably exemption you from MATH243. Not sure what's going on with PHYS373 yet.

        <h2 id=Text>Content of the post</h2> My child who ultimately wants to go to UMD has made half-assed attempts at a small community college in small, rural area.   When they apply to UMD would they be able to just not mention their experience at community college?  Is there anyway UMD could know?  UMD may not even accept that course work and the GPA sucks, so there isn't a benefit to mentioning those courses.
        
        There was some financial aid accepted years ago but the loans have been paid.

        If it’s any consolation I am a transfer student with a horrible first try at college and I eventually got in.

        <br>Top Downvoted Comment 1: Hey, im a former MD CC student. Great idea to go to CC first, then get an asscoiates then apply to UMD. Do engineering!

        <br>Top Downvoted Comment 2: UMD is definitely going to want a full history.  I have several questions to you as a parent.
        
        1. are you suggesting that it is wise to tell you child to lie on their application?
        2. are you financing this endeavor without anything to convince you that they are ready to move forward?
        
        The truth is, starting anew at a community college and performing won't change their chance of success.  I'd suggest looking at the MTAP program.  It'll meet your mark with guaranteed admission.  The only problem is that it doesn't not guarantee admission into the harder degree programs.  Look here: [https://admissions.umd.edu/apply/maryland-transfer-advantage-program](https://admissions.umd.edu/apply/maryland-transfer-advantage-program)
        
        As an aside, when I applied, I included all schools prior.  Some were good, some were not.  The trend in my performance was the factor of acceptance.  It also brought credits for the work I did previously that met their standards.  Hard sciences were too old to matter in the early work but most of that wasn't so good anyway.  It made my day when I didn't have to retake calc though :)

        <h2 id=Title>Title: Should I take Gen-ed courses this summer or Intermediate core courses for my major?</h2>
        <h2 id=Text>Content of the post</h2> I am debating between taking BMGT350 (Medium level course) for summer or BMGT289I(Gen-ed). I have taken core courses BMGT364 and BMGT340 last year so far. Do gen-eds cost less than core courses or am I paying same for the credits. Thanks in advance for your help.

        <br>Top Upvoted Comment 1: You're paying the same price (it does not matter if you register for gen eds or a core course you pay the same amount). If you're trying to save money I would recommend that you do not do gen eds over the summer and only do core courses over the summer if it will help you graduate quicker or have a reasonable schedule during the semester.
        
        If money isn't a problem and you want to take classes you're interested in or you just want to boost your GPA then a gen-ed class over the summer could help. In my own experience, I found BMGT350 easy to take during the semester and I know people who had complaints about taking it over the summer, but it really is not too bad.
        <span id=number>The comment has 8 upvotes</span>
        <br>Top Upvoted Comment 2: 1) off the bat, I would definitely recommend taking an intermediate core class during the summer. A gen-ed can be done at any time during your degree journey. In some cases, it can even be replaced by some other course that qualifies it.   
        
        
        Whereas a core class might be a pre-requisite for another.... or simply brings you one step closer in finishing your degree (and its one less class to stress about haha).   
        
        
        2) you pay the same amount ***per credit*** during the summer for any course-- gen-ed or core course, does not matter. Likewise in the regular semester-- but all 12+ credits are included in your **Full-Time tuition** payment, so you're saving a little more there.   
        
        
        3) in ThatFPS' reply, they also have another take on your case that makes sense too! so if you want a GPA booster and have money to spare-- then by all means you got it with a gen-ed over the summer, or if you want to guarantee a focused (but accelerated learning) environment for that single core class, there's that option too.

        Im a freshman at UMD and I had some questions about how summer classes work. Does the credit apply to fall 2023 or spring 2023 GPA? Also I haven't applied to housing yet but I really wish to dorm over the summer and was wondering if they could possibly allow that? Please let me know. Thank you!

        <br>Top Upvoted Comment 1: A lot of WGSS classes will fulfill these requirements. I am a WGSS minor, and all of those classes tend to be interesting and manageable. Usually, the grade is 2-4 big assignments, some kind of self-graded participation, and a weekly discussion/notes. The WGSS department is pretty forward-thinking, especially for lower levels, in the sense that they think grades aren't representative of the work, so it is usually based on effort. 
        
        Other departments to look into would be ANTH or CMLT. These departments usually have easy electives. Also, CMLT is not really an undergrad major at UMD, so the classes they offer are designed to be electives. 
        
        I would recommend going to Planet Terp and searching by GenEds under the tools tab to see the grade distribution for classes. Then you can look at reviews to figure out which would work best for you.

        <br>Top Upvoted Comment 1: In theory, you can get close. This almost never works out though. You're going to be very much at the mercy of scheduling of just the right CMSC4xx courses to flesh out the full set of obligations. There are all manner of ways that goes wrong. (Sched conflicts, seat availability, more.) There is lore about how/whether you double count that MATH course for both major credit there and area upper level in CS, so look into that with advisor.
        
        That's the theory. In practice we always wonder why someone would want to do this. I don't know of anyone who got close at least who ended up with a degree anyone cares about. The upper levels in CS are selected by desperate need to fit them in, not because they are right. There is no flex to shop for the right instructors (as in, great professors and not just popular or easy lecturers.) You burn any opportunity to do thoughtful research, internships and more that would have been useful and career enhancing. I say this with all good intentions: the win is not to finish fastest but to finish best. Anyway, best of luck with that!

        <br>Top Upvoted Comment 2: Bad idea. I wouldn’t risk getting low grades and failing some classes over trying to graduate early. College isn’t a race, you should try and seek real world experiences and network instead of studying 24/7, which you will be with this schedule. Remember, jobs, internships, networking, and social experiences are also extremely important to making you a well rounded person after university.

        <h2 id=Text>Content of the post</h2> I am a CS freshman. I have taken 4 AP courses so far (self-study)
        
        &#x200B;
        
        1) Math-Calculus BC - received a score of 4 \[MATH 140 and MATH 141 - 8 credits\]
        
        2) Computer Science A - received a score of 4 \[Lower Level Elective\]
        
        3) Economics- Macro - received a score of 5 \[ECON 201\]
        
        4) Economics- Micro - received a score of 5 \[ECON 200\]
        
        &#x200B;
        
        I plan to take the following APs to get additional transfer credit in UMD to knock off a few credits so that I can take additional upper division courses or a second Major.
        
        &#x200B;
        
        5) Chemistry - expected to get a score of 5 \[CHEM 131 and CHEM 132 (DSNL); CHEM 271 - 6 credits\]
        
        6) Statistics - expected to get a score of 4 \[STAT 100 (FSMA AND FSAR) - 3 credits\]
        
        7) Psychology - expected to get a score of 4 \[PSYC 100 - 3 credits\]
        
        8) Physics C: Mechanics - expected to get a score of 4 \[PHYS 161 and PHYS 261 (DSNL) - 4 credits\]
        
        9) Physics C: Electricity and Magnetism - expected to get a score of 4 \[PHYS 260 and PHYS 271 (DSNL) - 4 credits\]
        
        &#x200B;
        
        Based on the UMD's "Advanced Placement Exams (AP) for General Education (Effective for May 2023 exams)" pdf, I have listed the UMD courses along with the # of credits in brackets that I may be credited for. 
        
        &#x200B;
        
        Can any of you who have already gone through this provide feedback on whether I can get credits for all the APs I took and am planning to take? Today is the last to register for the APs and I would appreciate your feedback.
        
        &#x200B;
        
        Additionally, is it recommended to take either Physics 1 and 2 or Physics C Mech and C E&M? All four courses provide the same number of credits (4 credits) and I've heard that the C courses are a bit harder yet shorter.

        <h2 id=Title>Title: Suggestions on Graduate Off-Campus Housing?</h2>
        <h2 id=Text>Content of the post</h2> Hey everyone, I'm a newly admitted grad student and I would like some advice on graduate housing. My budget is $700-$1300, and the places I have in mind are 3x3 or 4x4 plans at University View, Varsity and Courtyards. I  don't have a car so I would want to live in walking distance to the engineering campus or near a bus route. I heard it's way more affordable to get a house but since I'm moving from out of state and don't know anyone at UMD at the moment I don't think that's an option for me :')
        
        Any advice/info on which is better between UView, Varsity and Courtyards (in terms of management, facilities, mailing, etc.)? Thanks!

        <h2 id=Title>Title: Courses Disappearing on Testudo?</h2>
        <h2 id=Text>Content of the post</h2> Last night, I was browsing some classes to join after not really vibing with a current course I'm taking, and I noticed that there were a few courses that seemed to be newly added but full or almost full. I tried adding one course on Drop/Add but it told me that the course wasn't being offered this semester, which is weird because it had 49/50 spots filled. 
        
        I went onto the schedule of classes this morning, and the class is completely gone! It doesn't show up on the schedule of classes at all. 
        
        Has anyone ever experienced this before? I'm really bummed because it would fit perfectly in my schedule and fulfills a major requirement. I contacted the professor to see if she really was teaching this class but it's Labor Day. I'm also going to get in touch with the CCJS department. 
        
        I'm a CCJS major for context, the class was CCJS418A with Madoo.

        <h2 id=Title>Title: Is a 3.6 GPA good enough for UMD(Hear me out)</h2>
        <h2 id=Text>Content of the post</h2> Hello,
        
        I'm in state and my gpa is a 3.6UW/4.3W after Junior year. In junior year I took 11 courses, with 8 being AP Courses and 2 being dual enrollment courses(Just adding this to show my course rigor), and my gpa went from a 3.9 to 3.6. I want to major in physics or applied physics, but I just feel like my grades will prevent me from getting in. Has anyone had a similar experience and got in? Is it over for me?
        
        Thanks!

        <h2 id=Title>Title: Help with gen ed courses</h2>
        <h2 id=Text>Content of the post</h2> Hello!
        
        I’m a Freshman and I’m kinda lost on the gen-eds I should be taking this Fall 2023. So when I look at my CS 4-year plan all gen eds that I see are (DSNS, DSHS, DSSP,…) and there is NO for example DVUP or SCIS gen-eds on my schedule.  
        So now let’s say I want to choose between three courses which have DSSP,DVUP and DSSP, SCIS and DSSP respectively.  
        Now taking either one wouldn’t have a difference right? since I don’t have a gen-ed labeled as DVUP or SCIS in my 4 year plan right?  
        OR should I take for example the one that fulfills 2 gend-eds because it is important although there isn’t anything written in my 4 year plan.
        
        In other words, if in my 4-year CS plan there is no DVUP or other geneds taking or not taking them wouldn’t have a difference? Or would it still matter and count towards my gen-eds?
        
        Sorry, it might sound a little confusing but I would appreciate your help!

        <br>Top Upvoted Comment 1: you need dvup and i-series to graduate, the reason why theyre not on your plan is because most of the time you’ll be able to double dip for them, like the ones you found. if you can knock out more gen ed credits with just one class then you should do it

        I-series (IS) courses always double count with some other category.
        
        Scholarship in practice (SP) courses can sometimes double count with some other category.
        
        Just make sure you get all of your requirements done rather that following the sample plan.  They write those things to make it look easy to graduate.

        <h2 id=Text>Content of the post</h2> I'm a first year student at UMD and I'm considering taking a math course at a community college over the summer. I've seen/heard about the transfer credit database, but I'm not sure if a course needs to be listed there for me to receive credit for it. Can anyone clarify whether UMD “ONLY” accepts courses listed on the transfer credit database, or if there's a process for submitting courses for “review” that are not listed? Any insight is appreciated 🙏

        <h2 id=Title>Title: GenEd courses</h2>
        <h2 id=Text>Content of the post</h2> Hi there, I am an international transfer student I am transferring 60+ credits from my previous university. When I took a look to my program's requirements there are a few GenEd courses that j need to take; I noticed there are some classes that fulfill those requirements all in one class (say one class is counted as a HS, UP, IS course) the thing is, I'm over 60 credits now and most of them (almost all) seem to be restricted to students with 60 credits or less.. My question is, is there anything I can do about that? What are my options? Of course it is not ideal to take one class for HS, one for UP, etc when I can take just one that fulfills several of them.. And if course that'll mean more time and money... So I'm concerned that I'll be just stuck because of those requirements
        
        Moreover, I found a class that I'd like to enroll into but it says "permission required", can I still get on? How do I get that permission?
        
        Thank you so much,

        <br>Top Upvoted Comment 1: i’m probably gonna call with this situation too bc i’m transferring 60 credits-ish altogether but half of them seem to not even be accepted. i’ve been told to just go to the college directly and literally demand they accept what you have. ik as an international it might be difficult but argue your place and see if you can find a way to not even have to make up the credits and spend money you shouldn’t even have to spend

        <br>Top Upvoted Comment 2: I also am over 60 credits and am having a hard time getting into certain gen eds. I'd recommend just getting on the holdfile, just by trying to register for the class. The holdfile is basically the waitlist after the waitlist-- it's for students who aren't "eligible" for the class, in your case that's having over 60 credits. On the first day of classes, the holdfile gets put on the waitlist. That's probably the only way you'd get into a 60 credit restricted class. I believe winter and summer classes don't do the whole [seat management plan](https://www.registrar.umd.edu/current/registration/seatmanagement.html), so you could register for gen eds in the summer if you really can't get any during the Fall.

        <h2 id=Title>Title: I need some insight on courses for Fall ‘24 (SPH)</h2>
        <h2 id=Text>Content of the post</h2> These are the courses I’m planning on taking for Fall ‘24. This would be my first semester as a public health major (previously bio). I just want some insight in terms of difficulty of the courses. I might also add another ‘options course’ which would take me to a total of 17 credits. Also if there are any recommendations for professors please let me know. Any advice in general would be appreciated!

        <br>Top Upvoted Comment 1: Hi,
        
        I have experience with these courses as I’m a senior public health major who also was previously a bio major. 
        
        **SPHL100 - Dr. La-Touche Howard**
        
        She will suggest that you buy an online textbook that’s like $60ish that is written by her and another person. It’s up to you if you want to buy it or not. I did when I took the class. Some of the questions that are on the weekly quizzes will come from readings and videos associated with the book. So again, it’s up to you if you decide to buy the book or not. You can certainly pass the quizzes without the book though. 
        
        There’s what’s called a Community Analysis Project (CAP) in place of exams in the class. It’s basically a semester long project that ends in a paper and media component about a public health issue in your community. Just hope that you get a good group for it so that work for the group related parts of the project can go smoothly. 
        
        At the end of the semester, I think the two lowest quiz scores are dropped. At least that was the case when I took the class. Also for the enrichment activity lectures, you only go on either Monday or Wednesday, not both, depending on what group you are in. 
        
        I would say that the class has an average level of difficulty. It’s not excessively hard but you just need to keep up with things. 
        
        **MIEH300 - Took it with Rianna Murray, have no insight on professor teaching it next semester**
        
        There’s 10 weekly assignments and 12 weekly lecture quizzes. 
        There’s two exams: the midterm and the final. When I took it, the midterm was online and the final was in person. 
        
        My professor at the time did in class pop quizzes but that might not be the case with your professor. She also did not post the lecture slides ahead of time but again, that might not be the case with your professor. 
        
        For lab, you have to do an environmental health in the news where you basically find an article related to environmental health and present it in a short summary and then ask two discussion questions. There’s three labs that you will do throughout the semester: an air, earth, and water lab. For the air lab, you have to measure air quality using an air quality sensor in two different locations that you and your group choose. The air lab ends in a final report. For the water lab, you have to collect two water samples and test them using various tests. The water lab ends in a discussion and conclusion assignment. For the earth lab, you and your group will be assigned to a position regarding the Navajo uranium mines and you’ll have to defend your position during a mock hearing that takes place in class. 
        
        I would say that this class has a slightly higher than average level of difficulty. Just try to stay on top of things and try to get a good group for lab. 
        
        **EPIB301 - Dr. Dyer**
        
        This class has two exams, plus the final. It has eight homework assignments with the last one being optional and two projects. There’s also thirteen discussion participation assignments. When I took the class, my TA went over the answers to the discussion assignment at the end of class so everyone just did it and submitted it right then and there. 
        
        Dr. Dyer posts all the lecture slides ahead of time and is very approachable. For certain lectures, she gave out candy and she ordered pizza for after the final exam. For exams, she does review sessions and there’s a formula sheet for all the exams. 
        
        I would say that this class has an average level of difficulty. 
        
        I didn’t take BSCI202 at UMD so I can’t speak on it but if you have any questions, you can just reply to my comment or message me.

        <h2 id=Title>Title: Help me decide: UMD vs. UVA for CS</h2>
        <h2 id=Text>Content of the post</h2> I'm a Maryland resident admitted that wants to go into CS/robotics (and maybe engineering management). I got into both UMD (Gemstone + $5k/yr scholarship) and UVA, but I've been feeling conflicted about choosing either, so I’m hoping that you guys can help me. Thanks!
        
        **Questions-wise, I was wondering a few things about UMD:**
        
        * What's the job/internship scene and curriculum like for UMD CS students?
        * Is Gemstone worth it? Is it easier to get involved in internships, job opportunities, and other on-campus research with it on your resume?
        * What's living in Ellicott Hall like? Do I recieve housing priority at Ellicott every year as a Gemstone student?
        * How easy is it to double major/double minor/study abroad as a CS student?
        * How generous is UMD financial aid typically? (I still have not received my results)
        * What's the campus culture at UMD like in general?
        
        Other things I'm considering:
        
        **UMD**
        
        Pros:
        
        * Stronger CS program.
        * Has a dedicated Robotics and Autonomous Systems and Project Management minors I'm interested in.
        * GEMSTONE Honors program would help get me immediately into research and find a tight-knit community.
        * Closer location to DC and Baltimore would help me network better.
        * Plenty of my friends will be there.
        
        Cons:
        
        * Higher cost than UVA right now even with scholarship ($26k + differential tuition for CS). **\*\*BUT** UMD need-based financial aid hasn't come back yet.
        * Less academic flexibility than UVA. **\*\*BUT** most of my gen-ed requirements are out of the way because of AP credits.
        * GEMSTONE dorms are lowkey horrible (no AC).
        
        **UVA**
        
        Pros:
        
        * Stronger name recognition overall and still a strong CS program.
        * Cheaper option as of now ($21k/yr after need-based aid)
        * Has dedicated Engineering Business minor (and stronger business reputability in general).
        * Greater academic flexibility with double majoring and transferring into/out of departments
        * Guaranteed freshman year housing with actual AC.
        * Charlottesville seemed like a nicer place than College Park and Grounds was beautiful.
        
        Cons:
        
        * Not that great of a fit for robotics (much less opportunities than UMD).
        * Not admitted into any honors/distinction programs.
        * More isolated location might limit networking opportunities.
        * I've heard UVA has a more preppy and fratty student culture.

        Engineering management is something you get into after spending at least several years doing engineering work. Not something that undergrad is going to pipeline you into, unless you mean PM type work, in which case a CS program isn't necessarily going to cover what you're looking for.

        If we take the worst case scenario and I have to take Calc again at UMD, any chance I can take Object Oriented Programming I and Calc at a community college over summer and then object oriented programming II at UMD in fall before applying to CS at the end of the first semester? Any opinions would help. Thanks

        <h2 id=Title>Title: Transfer Student</h2>
        <h2 id=Text>Content of the post</h2> Hi UMD students, So I kinda have a notion in which a 3.0 gpa for transfer student is what likely get you in and it’s a safety bet after that but there is a major problem that happened I had a 2.9 gpa and was very confident to apply this spring and be admitted this fall but apparently one of my courses my professor accused me of academic dishonesty when in fact wasn’t true and gave me an F for the course and when contesting this accusation and problem the department in charge of the accusation did not care and left me with an F I’m coming from Penn State and want to enroll at UMD as a transfer student but my GPA dropped dramatically to a 2.37 and I wanted to apply EA this spring and be hopefully accepted for fall 2024 are my chances none or ok-ish? I’m taking other courses currently at my current institution and will raise my GPA back to about a 3.1 to 2.9 again so after this spring semester I should be ok so do I have any chances of getting in this fall? Can I apply again to UMD once my gpa is back up? Should I tell them about the situation on a email and see if they sympathize with me? I’m retaking the same course I gotten an F to show UMD I’m getting an A for the class like I should have gotten last semester
        
        
        I have loads of good extracurriculars and essay but grades are the main factor of my concerns and I won’t be considered as a competitive applicant according to UMD and likely not even be seen at all plus the holistic review might not apply to me currently 
        
        Intended major : Undecided Business (LEP) but if I get into L&S is good enough
        
        My main questions are these 3:
        
        1-Can I be accepted with the 2.37 with low chances or I have zero hopes for this EA cycle?
        
        2-Can I re-apply again for spring 2025 when my gpa goes back up?
        
        I won’t be taking the CC route unfortunately so that would be out of the table for now
        
        3-Apply normally without the F and email the letter explaining this situation attached to the application?
        
        I would love if people could answer these 3 questions I feel so overwhelmed and I really wanted to go to UMD asap (Also bonus info I’m not a out-state student I’m applying for in-state as a MD resident would that be a thing that would harm my application even more?)

        <h2 id=Title>Title: Immersive Media Design B.S. Computing - degree name?</h2>
        <h2 id=Text>Content of the post</h2> As per [https://imd.umd.edu/about/degree-programs](https://imd.umd.edu/about/degree-programs) :
        
        "*The Bachelor of Science in Computing focuses on the technical foundations that underpin immersive media projects and software. Students take the same core sequence of courses as Computer Science majors while taking art courses in design and digital media. This degree pathway requires the core sequence of IMDM courses, eight courses in computer science, and four courses in ARTT, in addition to general education campus requirements.*"
        
        **What is the name of the degree itself?** **Is it "Bachelor of Science in Computing"? Or is it "Bachelor of Science in Immersive Media Design"? Or is it "Bachelor of Science in Immersive Media Design & Computing"?** 
        
        In case good "CS + immersive media design" jobs are not available at the time of graduation, it might be imperative to try general software development jobs. And for applying for general software development jobs, having "Computing" featured prominently in the degree name will be helpful.

        <h2 id=Title>Title: GPA</h2>
        <h2 id=Text>Content of the post</h2> Question: Earlier this semester I requested to change my major to criminology which was approved and goes into effect in the spring. Since it is an LEP, it requires that I keep my gpa at a minimum 2.0. There might be a chance that my gpa goes slightly under a 2.0 after this semester is over so I’m just wondering if I’d be able to take a class in the winter to improve my gpa just in time for the spring or if it’s a done deal after this fall semester?

        <br>Top Downvoted Comment 2: if you are able to, take an easy elective at your local community college (that's equivalent to a class here) and have that transfer over! you'll save a lot of money taking it at a CC compared to over here.
        
        before you do that, make sure you fill out a permission to enroll form

        <h2 id=Title>Title: Need help with courses</h2>
        <h2 id=Text>Content of the post</h2> I have been accepted into UMD for the 2024 spring semester (Letters and Sciences). I want to go through the gateway requirements for a Computer Science major. I plan on enrolling for Freshman Connection and taking some of the general classes as well as some of the required courses for a CS major. I tried looking through the class registration page for CS, and the general and core class tab leads to an error page. I would like to know what classes I should take during Freshman Connection and which classes to take during the spring semester. I would also like to know if it would be too late to register for CMSC 131/133, CMSC 132, and MATH 140 because I am aware that it is first come first serve. If these classes are full, will I be able to take them during the Spring? I would really appreciate some advice and information regarding which classes to take. 
        
        Thank you so much for your time!

        <h2 id=Text>Content of the post</h2> I'm more interested in professors in CMNS since that's my college; but as a more general rule, I want to inspect how to accurately gauge how compatible I would be with certain instructors (modulo any inherent, latent affinities for the course material) beyond "So-and-so is just the GOAT!".

        <br>Top Upvoted Comment 1: Larry Herman. A lot of people like the fact that he is super detailed on his project descriptions and that he gives out plenty of resources. But, equally, a lot of people hate him because of his device policy and how condescending and just weird he can be.
        <span id=number>The comment has 103 upvotes</span>
        <br>Top Upvoted Comment 2: Kruskal is extremely smart and very good at most of his job. But, the only interaction most students have with him is in their undergraduate 351 course, which is A) a difficult course in and of itself, and B) a course the school actively uses to weed students out. Couple this with the facts that teaching 351 isn't exactly his favorite, he prefers to delegate all administrative stuff to his TAs (meaning HW solutions and grades can take a long time to be released), and after probably 40+ years of teaching he's very set in his ways, most students hate him.
        
        But talk to people who have done research with him, taken 451, or TA'd for him, and you'll find a bunch of people who actually like him, or at least understand why the 351 kids are wrong about him. Besides, he's also the most chill professor I ever met -- as long as you had a halfway reasonable reason why your HW would be late or you couldn't take an exam on a certain day, he was always more than happy to accommodate, and he was pretty generous about giving partial credit if you could show you understood the core principles of the material.
        
        At the end of the day, for all the bitching you hear about him, the vast majority of his students pass, and the only ones that fail really, really deserved it (like getting < 20% on exams and clearly just memorized how to solve specific questions instead of learning the core ideas of the course).

        <br>Top Upvoted Comment 1: CMSC330 - Awesome. Actually learned and understood most of the material, and the exams didn't make me want to pull my hair out. TAs were amazing.
        
        CMSC351 - Not so awesome. I did fine (I think), but it was significantly more stressful than any of my other classes. Still don't even know what percentage I have in the class, so there's that...
        
        ENEE200 - The most BS class I've taken. A good bit of writing, but it was mostly all fluff. I literally ended the class with over 100%.
        
        INST201 - Definitely an interesting course and Dr. Vitak was super accommodating, but man that group research paper still sucked.
        
        COMM107 - My professor was such an angel, she really made everything so much more bearable. I hate public speaking, but I was able to do well because of her :)

        <br>Top Upvoted Comment 2: CMSC 330: Great course, very well run. Learned a lot from it and the material was super interesting. Goated TAs and professors in this class.
        
        CMSC 351: Went really well until the final. Maybe it's because I found the topics after the first midterm (NP, graph algorithms, parallel processing) not as interesting, or I was just mentally drained, but I wish I ended the semester better. I'm expecting either a B or B+, so still not bad.
        
        MATH 241: Went really well. Wiseley Wong is a goat. Take home exams made the class pretty chill, and I understood everything that was taught.
        
        ENGL 393: I despise this class. Do not take with Joan Mooney. I ended with an A-, so it's not like I did bad, but she made this class so much harder than it needed to be.
        
        Overall, not a bad semester, but fuck english.

        <br>Top Downvoted Comment 1: ANSC 314- Dr. Sunny needs to be fired or replaced, at LEAST. Literally the WORST fucking class I've ever taken and I passed Chem with a teacher shift halfway through and having to take a final written by a completely different prof that had shit we never covered on it. This was my second time taking it and I'm sure that my saving grace was that he unpublished the course before the final, which fucked everything up and made it a 24 hour word doc exam. Took me 14 hours. He somehow got worst than last year and is just a total asshole when people ask questions. He has absolutely 0 idea of how Bonus points work. He was making our exams out of 105 points and refusing to understand that raises the stakes. When someone tried to explain it, he legit said that he had been teaching for a long time and was smarter than her. I could go on forever, honestly. He's only there for research and he doesn't give two shits about students.
        
        My other class was Wildlife Diseases, but I can't remember the number. It was super easy, no exams, just discussions and a presentation.

        <br>Top Downvoted Comment 2: MATH406 with Manning - Manning was a really good online professor. Really good lecturer, clear explanations. The homeworks took about 3 to 5 hours a week. Tests were fair and medium difficulty, quizzes were easy but stressful. Every exam was closed note, traditional timing. The content was interesting. Probably one of my favorite courses.
        
        CMSC330 with DVH - super well run CS course. The TAs were awesome especially Shilpa and James. DVH was a little boring and convoluted but he was understanding and a decent lecturer. Clickers were annoying, quizzes were somewhat challenging. Exams were the fairest I've seen this semester. Projects were interesting albeit more challenging than 132 projects but still easier than 216 projects.
        
        CMSC351 with Kruskal - Kruskal is very nice and a cute old man, but the class was disorganized and it was hard to figure out how you were doing. Too much weight was on exams which made them unnecessarily nerve wracking. I was honestly too paralyzed by the weight of the final to even study for it, but it turned out fine. The exams are predictable since they are heavily based on homeworks.
        
        HACS200 - Wayyyy too much work for 2 credits and I wish the grading was more holistic.
        
        HACS208P with Charles Harry - One of the best professors ever, really inspiring, helpful guy. Also my worst performance in a class ever. The content was really interesting but my memory is really not good enough for the exams. I rewatched all the lectures before the final, made flashcards, still got a C on the final.

        <h2 id=Title>Title: academic dismissal questions </h2>
        <h2 id=Text>Content of the post</h2> So, due to a ton of issues I've had during my first two semesters at UMD it looks like I am at risk for academic dismissal. It's possible for me to avoid it but by a slim chance. Anyway, I wanted to know if I am academically dismissed and then reinstated in the upcoming semester would I still have the housing that I was assigned to for the upcoming semester? Would I also have to pick any classes that I have already registered for over again? And if my application is denied for reinstatement for the fall semester would I be reinstated during the spring? And if that happens how would that affect housing? And lastly, is there any way that I could take classes over the upcoming summer semester that could help me not be academically dismissed?

        I am grad student who is dealing with a lot of stress recently and have been depending on cigarettes to calm myself down.

        I don’t want to bother anyone and just want to deal with my own problems so it would be nice if the place is not crowded.

        <h2 id=Text>Content of the post</h2> Okay so I was super down because even though I walked the stage in May, I failed a class that I needed to get my diploma.
        
        I was suffering from severe depression and got put on meds literally three weeks before the spring semester was supposed to end.  After graduation, I just stayed in bed and barely ate... everything you could think of when it comes to depression.
        
        I had to ask to take the class a third time and went to an advisor. I was so nervous but the advisor literally was an angel (maybe because she was also in charge of granting permission) and after I told her my story, she told me to just sign up whenever and wished me luck.
        
        I took the summer course and was nervous since I bombed the midterm but have been doing really good in homework and other assignments.
        
        I AM NOW GLAD TO SAY I PASSED THE CLASS AND AM DONE WITH UMD.
        
        Things are really looking up. So I’m posting this just to say, things will get better even when they don’t seem like it.

        <h2 id=Title>Title: Deciding Between UMD and Purdue</h2>
        <h2 id=Text>Content of the post</h2> Hi, I am a high school senior who was offered a transfer pathway to Georgia Tech for Fall 2024, and am currently trying to decide where to attend college for freshman year before transferring.
        
        My intended major is CS and my top choices currently are Purdue and UMD (Freshman Connection + Spring Admit). In order to transfer into Georgia Tech, I need to keep a 3.3 minimum overall GPA and math/lab science GPA., and take a two-course lab science sequence (chemistry, physics, biology, or environmental science).  I was wondering whether it'd be hard to meet this requirement at UMD. 
        
        I've also heard that through Freshman Connection, I will be the last to register for classes during the spring semester. Will that make it too difficult to sign up for the courses I need?

        <h2 id=Title>Title: Off Campus Housing</h2>
        <h2 id=Text>Content of the post</h2> Hello everyone. I’m wanting to move off campus starting spring semester because my difficult classes start then and I really don’t wanna deal with a one hour commute while dealing with pre med classes along my classes for my major. I found a decent chunk of off campus places under 700 a month for rent. Does anyone know if UMD hires students for on campus jobs during the spring semester and how I can afford to cook and groceries? Any help is appreciated!
        
        Edit: I should add that spring registration is in a month or so and I need to find a way how to comfortably live off campus while not being extremely far away and afford everything.

        Housing:
        
        I won't be dorming next semester, how different is a students lifestyle on campus and off-campus? This semester I got by just staying in my dorm all day and never really went to class due to my easish course load out . I'm assuming living off campus would require you to attend daily and force better discipline in terms of eating and sleeping schedules.
        
        Also, when is the best time to get an apartment/off campus housing, and when/where are the cheapest deals?
        
        Course Load:
        
        In this semester I took CMSC250, 132, MATH241 and COMM107
        
        Next semester I'll be taking MATH406, CMSC216, MATH246, STAT410, INST152
        
        How much harder will my course load be relative to my previous courses? (Got all A's/A+'s in my courses so far and I kinda set myself to a strict standard though I recognize this will probably lead to burnout at some time)
        
        Finances:
        
        has anyone taken loans up to 15-20k to stay here? If so how bad is it and how does loan financing work? Additionally, how likely is it to get an internship sophomore year summer that can cover this amount for my junior year so I don't necessarily have to take loans again in my 3rd year?
        
        most importantly
        
        will I be fine? I could always graduate early since i have about 80ish credits but i'm not really sure how everythings going to play out and I'm a little anxious i might just crash despite enjoying this school (I love learning from my lectures and the people here are generally really nice)

        <br>Top Upvoted Comment 1: 20K in loans is not that bad. It will probably around $200 a month after you graduate. They have online calculators if you want a more precise figure. You complete a FAFSA form and get financial aid through the school. Do it sooner rather than later.

        <br>Top Downvoted Comment 1: 1. Ass. You might be able to request but afaik its random
        
        2. Personally, once or twice a sem
        
        3. JUSTINS NOTES
        
        4. Yes, i was in the CC stream and it helped me get an internship at NASA JPL
        
        5. I have never read a textbook my whole time here. Im a junior. 
        
        6. Join social groups based around international students
        
        7. Lots of people go to bars, lots of people are in frats, both suck ass tbh. Dont feel pressured to do either, just focus on doing what you enjoy. Do what you enjoy, and youll naturally make friends along the way. These are your real friends. Not some drunk ass mf you stumble into at cstone. 
        7a. Go to DC! The metro is right there, and its free! Once you turn 21 the club scene is waaayy better than anything in college park (if thats your thing)
        7a.2. Go to riverdale. Hella high vibrations in the whole area (busboys and poets, that one bowling alley)
        
        3(8). Stamp, recwell, RA, etc. im pretty sure there are job postings somewhere if you look. ALSO consider getting a job off campus at a restaurant or coffee shop or something. This will be far more fulfilling and youll make way more money than staring at a bunch of sweaty mfs grunting for a few hours

        <br>Top Upvoted Comment 2: Before this thread turns into a complete bloodbath, I’d like to offer a few reopening suggestions:
        
        Hold *recorded* in person classes. That is to say, all forms of point-based lecture attendance, if existing, should be scrapped (looking at you, clickers). 
        
        If someone watching remotely has a question, they should be able to type it into an online portal (e.g. Piazza, Campuswire, even ELMS) such that a TA, professor, or even another student can quickly answer it. If some disingenuous fuck decides to abuse the system and spam troll comments or posts, they should be given one warning, then be banned from the class portal permanently and reported to the Office of Student Conduct.
        
        Discussions should function pretty much the same way as the above lectures. Any groupwork can be organized by putting in-person students in their own groups of 2-3, and the same for remote students. If simulation software exists for bio/chem/physics labs, it ought to be used when loss of accuracy to the real thing would be minimal.
        
        Thoughts?

        <h2 id=Text>Content of the post</h2> I'm sorta in a need of easy A for a gpa boost and I would like recommendations for spring of 2024. Preferably classes that are online or have no exams would be best. I'm currently undecided right now and depending if I fail this class i'll have either 21 or 24 credits. I don't really care too much about the subject of the class. if possible 3 credit classes but less is also fine

        <br>Top Upvoted Comment 1: ENES140, ENES461, and HLTH377 are probably the easiest classes at UMD. They are fully asynchronous too, altogether the total course load for the whole semester can probably be done in a day or two. For ENES140, and ENES461 lots of people complain about it because there are only a few assignments and they get a few questions wrong, but honestly the questions are incredibly easy as long as you don't over think them

        Hello all, this is random. If any of you are interested in taking an elective/fill in summer course, HESP 202 is open. It is online, easy A and asynchronous from May 28 to July 5th with Sarah Zsak
        
        This professor just won her cancer battle. She tried to teach this course last summer and it was canceled due to low enrollment. She wants to teach it this year, there are 12 seats left. Being a HESP student myself, I thought I shed some light because this course deserves some recognition.

        <h2 id=Title>Title: PSA: new courses on mental health open to all UMD students</h2>
        <h2 id=Text>Content of the post</h2> Hi r/UMD! I'm [Dr. Amy Morgan](https://sph.umd.edu/people/amy-morgan), an Asst Professor in the Family Science department with a background in mental health. Since I started in 2020, I've noticed a significant increase in both mental health crises among college students ([happening nationally](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0165032722002774)) as well as interest in mental health careers. 
        
        I want college students to have the necessary skills for mental wellness. So, I created two new courses to address these needs. Below is some info about each in case you are interested. 
        
        **FMSC340 - Mental Health and Healing in Families** \- (3 credits) now enrolling for Winter 2023 (online). [Click here](https://express.adobe.com/post/qT7Ljj5gIA1kX/) for the digital flyer and more info. This course covers mental health diagnoses, treatment, and skills/careers in the helping profession. Even if mental health is not your career path, you'll learn important mental health and social skills.
        
        **FMSC177 - U SAD? Coping with Stress, Anxiety, and Depression** \- (1 credit) now enrolling for Spring 2023 (in-person). [Click here](https://www.canva.com/design/DAFTApADA1o/agRWq4HuBcACxeAByP15Rg/view?utm_content=DAFTApADA1o&utm_campaign=designshare&utm_medium=link&utm_source=publishsharelink) for the digital flyer and more info. This is *NOT* a textbook/lecture class. Taught by myself and other practicing therapists, you'll learn practical skills on how to recognize and manage stress, anxiety, and depression, as well as how to effectively navigate relationships. 
        
        Please help me spread the word about these courses (open to all UMD students). I'm happy to answer any questions here or via email ([aamorgan@umd.edu](mailto:aamorgan@umd.edu)). Thanks, y'all, and take care of yourselves as you finish up this semester.

        <h2 id=Title>Title: Failing all my classes</h2>
        <h2 id=Text>Content of the post</h2> I'm a sophomore in CS and this semester has been an actual disaster. My mental health is in the gutter. 250, 216, and 240 are like the trifecta of death. I have a D in all 3 of these courses. Like for the second 240 exam I studied 4 in a row days before the exam and got a lower score than my friend who crammed the night before after spending all weekend playing league of legends. In 250 I don't even understand wtf the professor is saying half the time, meanwhile the other people will half pay attention and know whats happening. For my 250 and 240 the only practice people get is discusson. Like I swear to god I know people who will not understand anything in lecture, then just read through the notes in discussion the night before a quiz and get a 20/20 the next day. Like are you guys just super smart or am i missing something?? Like I know someone whos taking physics along with these 3 classes and they put in less effort than me. I'm so close to just dropping out of college at this point because this is insane

        <br>Top Downvoted Comment 2: Hey there, same boat regarding 250 and 240. I am a sophomore taking the exact same classes (and only these 3 classes).
        
        Specifically for 240, I started studying for both exams 2 weeks prior, going in TA office hours for help, studying practice exams, quizzes, and understanding the concepts… and didn’t get a passing mark on neither exams.
        
        It’s easy to compare yourself. I do too, seeing the mean, quartiles, and seeing that im part of the lower distribution. All you need to do is just keep doing your best. You today is smarter than you a week ago, just work hard for the last exam(s) and finals.
        
        Just know you aren’t alone, it seems everyone else is smarter but they usually just have a background of the material. A good amount are also people retaking the class. There’s people like me who still study hard but not get satisfactory scores, but it is what it is. I’m using this failiure as a motivating factor for the rest of the semester. Just focus on yourself and do your best. I know it’s hard to only focus on your self but at the very least still do your best.
        
        I wish you good luck with the rest of the semester. You can do it 👍

        <h2 id=Title>Title: Fall Admissions and Freshman Connection Questions</h2>
        <h2 id=Text>Content of the post</h2> Hi!  
        I've been deferred to Spring 2025 as of right now but can take freshman connection classes at UMD in the fall. However, I'm finishing high school with an associates degree. I was told that I might be able to get out of freshman connection fall 2024 and take regular classes since I have no gen eds to take and have the lower level classes for computer science taken (next class I need to take is CMSC 216, already taking discrete structures). 
        
        1. Is this actually a possibility?
        
        2. Who do I need to talk to to discuss taking upper level cs classes in freshman connection?
        
        3. Does getting pushed to spring semester because of "space limitations" actually have anything to do with my application?

In my experience and from talking to some professors, the ischool can be somewhat slow in actually posting classes to Testudo.

        <h2 id=Title>Title: Easy DSHU/DVUP? (And Gen-Eds with no exams?)</h2>
        <h2 id=Text>Content of the post</h2> My friend and I were planning out our schedules for Spring '24 when she realized she needed one more class to get to 15+ credits (she's pre-med). I'm taking SOCY224 this semester and she wants something similar in terms of time commitment, but a DSHU/DVUP.
        
        If you have anything in mind that meets those requirements, please share! Also, if you don't mind, please mention the year and the professor you took it with. If you don't want to date yourself by adding the year or a general range of when you took it, that's fine.
        
        Other than that... Feel free to share any Gen-Ed classes that have no exams. I could use a list of those.

        <h2 id=Title>Title: Good Gen-Eds for CS Major?</h2>
        <h2 id=Text>Content of the post</h2> Hi all, I'm an incoming CS major to UMD and I figured I'd take some Gen-Ed courses at my local CC over the summer to save stress and some money. What Gen-Ed courses should I get done at CC so that I don't have to worry about them during college (in other words what are the hardest required Gen-Ed courses)?
        
        I've also heard that some Gen-Ed courses can fulfill multiple requirements at once. If someone could let me know what courses those are that would be great. Also what are the easiest Gen-Ed's I can take during the school year?
        
        &#x200B;
        
        TLDR:
        
        Want to know the hardest Gen-Ed courses so I can do them at CC; also want to know the easiest courses to take to fulfill Gen-Ed requirements

        <br>Top Upvoted Comment 1: Some free advice worth what you paid for it: Talk with a professor or mentor about how to use Gen Eds as an opportunity, not an odious obligation to put behind you as quickly as possible. 
        
        The idea is to have a deep dive discussion with someone who knows the field (and UM's wares) to find which courses offer the greatest opportunity. Later you will need to figure out an upper level concentration, and potentially along the way there are other degree annotations to consider adding to your portfolio. No amount of thinking hard at this point can reveal to you whether any of those are "you". That is why people talk with mentors - to get best tips on undiscovered potential, then try them out. One doesn't work? Great, now you know, and know to move on to try others. Doing that at CC is kind of a dead end though as tracks you discover there might not have much to do with tracks which are available here, and likewise these things vary a lot by professors. 
        
        Bottom line: if you don't discover some new passion at college, then you're doing it wrong. So talk with people who know and find out the art of the possible. :)

        <h2 id=Title>Title: Fall 2024 Computer Science Transfer... What are my options?</h2>
        <h2 id=Text>Content of the post</h2> I'm currently a CS student at AACC who is planning on transferring to UMD in fall 2024. I started at AACC in fall of 2022 and was accepted into MTAP at the same time. I've heard of the new guidelines for transfer CS students, I already meet the GPA requirements and will get credit for MAT140, but cannot earn credit for CMSC131 or CMSC132 due to the classes not transferring from AACC to UMD.
        
        I was told to try taking the exemption exams , but due to the new CS guidelines, I'm now told that students taking the exemption exams for fall 2024 admission "...will have to apply to the Computer Science major through the standard internal transfer application process. Space is limited and admission is selective.", so I'm assuming that even though I am a student who matriculated at a MD CC before fall 2024, I have to follow the new guidelines and won't be guaranteed acceptance even if I meet the program requirements.
        
        So, worse case scenario, let's say that I take the exemption exams, then apply to the CS major and get rejected. What would be my other options?  Would something like computer engineering, or something else be a decent backup plan?
        
        (I'm sorry if this post is a little disheveled, I've been stressing about this all day and have to get my questions off my chest because I can't focus on anything due to the stress :') )

As long as you were a UMD or MD CC student, the old CS guidelines apply to you and as long as you meet them you will be accepted into the program. I figured that on the chance any other CC transfers were having similar worries I'd post a follow up :)

        <h2 id=Title>Title: Two questions: Is there a list of required Gen Ed courses? Do Gen Ed courses vary with major?</h2>
        <h2 id=Text>Content of the post</h2> Continuing the second question: Or do they stay the same, at least generally, with a couple of differences?
        
        I found this on the Gen Ed website:  [https://gened.umd.edu/documents/GeneralEducationSummaryChart.pdf](https://gened.umd.edu/documents/GeneralEducationSummaryChart.pdf), and from what I can gather, I need to complete *19* classes (40-46 credits) outside the courses specific to my major. Is that right?
        
        Edit: Well nevermind the first question, I found a [convenient checklist](https://www.gened.umd.edu/documents/GenEdChecklist.pdf) a minute after posting...  Second question still stands though.

        <h2 id=Title>Title: Best Online Course To Prepare for CMSC 131 and 132 exemption exams</h2>
        <h2 id=Text>Content of the post</h2> I am a student who is transferring into UMD this fall as an intended comp sci major and I have all the requirements done for the LEP except cmsc 131 and 132. I understand i coudl take these 2 classes when i get to umd and if i do well enough, I am automatically in the LEP. However, tht would set me back 2 semesters and that just doesnt make financial sense. I have no background knowledge on java or programmng in general but I figure since cmsc 131 and 132 is basically just a java course, can u guys possibly recommend any good online java courses that can be done in 3 months time frame and teach me the material? I want to take the cmsc 131 and 132 exemption exam by august and study over the summer, from may, right up till august, hence the time frame.

        First if you arent accepted directly into the cs passing exemption exams wont change that still must wait at least a semester to apply to get in(used to be auto admission if calc 1,131,and 132 c- and 2.7 gpa but i think something changded because some ppl in this reddit have had some issues i think)
        
        2. While you could find YouTubes to watch there is study material provided by the university here: https://undergrad.cs.umd.edu/external-new-student-exemption-exams.
        
        Also for 131 you can see if theres an available ap computer science A review or old test out there as that ap would get you out of 131

        <h2 id=Title>Title: Withdrawal from a class…not graduating “on time” as planned was the W worth it?</h2>
        <h2 id=Text>Content of the post</h2> Senior undergrad here. This is just a space in case anyone could relate. I just needed to vent. I took on 4 courses this semester for my last time here at UMD even though my mental health is suffering. I guess I’m disappointed in myself because I really thought I could tackle 4 courses/3 credit schedule and all I need to do is merely pass in order to graduate…easy enough right? What I didn’t know is midway through the semester I ended up choosing a very tedious course for what was supposed to be a fun elective not related to my major towards graduation for undergrad (unknowingly so, I might add) to fit in my schedule and ended up with an adjunct professor that made the class dull and miserable. Bear in mind, this adjunct was announced pretty last minute.
        
        I was doing decent in the course, but it seemed the TAs are the backbone to this course and they were doing a lot of the nitpicky grading…in addition I was appalled that the professor seemed to not know at all what she was talking about during lectures. For one, she asked the students to clarify the terms in the readings to help “refresh her” on what reading we were on for that week, often in a daze or confusion as if we were the professors. It’s like she just woke up from bed.
        
         This professor got very mad when we were not talking during Zoom breakout rooms despite giving no instructions to what to discuss apart from her yelling at us to “work on your project in class right now! Talk or you lose class  points which is a whole percentage deducted from your grade!” Many of us have already exchanged numbers and Groupmes to contact each other outside of class and already gotten a large portion of our work done outside of class like wtf. Even if you were working on the project individually (which a large majority of the class was), she wanted us to talk to random people in the class with a similar topic just to show we’re running our mouth. And it’s not just one class session. Every class session! The TA monitors the breakout rooms like hawks so most of us sit in silence because we are genuinely confused on what to talk about.
        
        The final straw was me receiving a 4 out of 10 on a major assignment from a TA who loosely graded it based on the subjectivity of me not using a “vast array of sources ie. Books, articles) for evidence. No where was that stated in the assignment directions. Dropped me a letter grade, and this course doesn’t have a lot of assignments. I checked the syllabus for upcoming assignments before dropping …it’s only going to get worse from here. I can’t even imagine the mental spins I would receive from the tediousness of this course as the course dragged on if I hadn’t dropped. But maybe I should have just pulled through, I don’t know.  I was getting tired of this course’s teaching style even though it was technically manageable at times.
        
         I should’ve dropped out a lot sooner and I do regret it because now I have a W on my transcript because I withdrawed. Which means I’m 117 credits short of the last 3 credits I needed torwards graduation. I’m going to walk the stage during graduation knowing I still have 1 class left I need to do—and my degree being shipped many months later. I could kick myself. I’m so disappointed because I felt I made a terrible choice in choosing this class. Now I have to take a summer class. It doesn’t really feel like real graduating when you still have one course to make up :( 
        
        
        Edit: I appreciate all the comments. Thank y’all for taking the time to write them. I appreciate it.

Then I went on to get an MBA.
        
        Everything can be done in your own time. Nothing is more important than your mental health and peace of mind. Just remember that life isn’t a sprint, it’s a marathon, and the only person you’re up against is yourself.

        <h2 id=Title>Title: Fall 2020 Semester Update1</h2>
        <h2 id=Text>Content of the post</h2>  ** As of June 15, 2020**
        
        Dear University of Maryland community,
        
        As a nation, we are at a crucible moment in our history. We face a pandemic that has caused widespread illness and death, and an economic crisis with the highest unemployment rate in a generation. The toll of both has been borne disproportionately by communities of color in America, as well as the most disadvantaged among us.Recently, we have seen the largest and most sustained mass protests in half a century against anti-black racism. The demands for justice have prompted other institutions, including higher education, to confront systemic racism embedded in organizational culture and policies.At the time of our nation's greatest peril, President Lincoln said that "a house divided cannot stand." He believed that America cannot be a free and equal democracy and, at the same time, tolerate inequality and injustice. I am heartened to see the large number of peaceful and racially diverse demonstrators for equity and justice. I believe there is more that unites us than what divides us -- that in the face of injustice and suffering, there is underlying solidarity, compassion, and hope.Seeing all the young people in these protests calls to mind John Dewey's observation that democracy must be reborn in every generation, and education lies at the heart of this rebirth. I am confident that our University community will meet the crucible moment. This is an opportunity for transformation. Our Vice President for Diversity and Inclusion, Georgina Dodge, will lead a campus-wide effort of senior administrators, faculty, staff and students to increase shared understandings, spur changes in policy, and promote actions to combat institutionalized racism.Mindful of the disparate impacts of COVID-19, our planning for a phased and safe reopening of the physical campus takes into account considerations of equity and inclusion.
        
        **Framework and plans for phased re-opening of the campus in fall 2020**  
        Over the past several weeks, the University has been engaged in an extensive and collaborative effort to develop a framework and plans for the phased reopening in fall semester 2020. This planning has been coordinated with state and county officials and guided by recommendations of the University System of Maryland (USM). The University leadership is also consulting with the University Senate leadership in this planning process.Seven work-groups, and numerous subcommittees, have worked tirelessly on these plans. In all, over 200 faculty, staff, administrators, and outside experts have been involved in this planning process.Four core principles inform the work of these groups:
        
        * Prioritize the health and safety of every member of the University community.
        * Protect and support the educational and research missions to maintain academic excellence.
        * Make decisions grounded in our values of equity and inclusion.
        * Provide timely and transparent communication to, and obtain feedback from, internal and external stakeholders about the proposed plans.
        
        I will briefly highlight the work group plans, and additional information will continue to be added to [**umd.edu/virusinfo**](https://maestro.listserv.umd.edu/trk/click?ref=zvb24p867_2-2304x31f74x08867&). Risk management of COVID-19 is an evolving process. The disease is evolving. Scientific and clinical knowledge of the disease is evolving. The risks cannot be eliminated, but they can be reduced. We are putting into place the personnel, organizational structures, and plans to manage as responsibly as possible these risks as we gradually re-open the campus. The University's response will evolve until a vaccine or treatment is available.
        
        **Health and safety: a multifaceted and integrated plan for COVID-19 surveillance, testing, and early warning**  
        The University 's plan has five components to safely reopen and operate the campus, with early identification of infectious cases as the key to limit outbreaks.
        
        (1) ***Daily self-monitoring and reporting of temperature and any onset of symptoms*** by all faculty, staff, and students who are on campus. Temperature gauges will be provided and the reporting can be done electronically, or by filling out a form, with safeguards for personal data privacy. If there is fever and/or symptoms, diagnostic testing for SARS-COV2, the virus that causes the COVID-19 disease, will be required. If the test is positive, consultation with a health care provider and isolation will be required.
        
        (2) ***Population surveillance testing to ascertain the baseline infection rate on campus.*** At this time, our goal is to make this testing available to all faculty and staff who wish to be tested, and to consider requiring it of all students on campus. The CDC guidance is to test only when there are symptoms. However, as some public health experts have pointed out, this guidance does not take into account the fact that a large percentage of infected persons are asymptomatic.Our University Health Center conducted a pilot test project last week that involved about 250 volunteer faculty and staff and student athletes. Nurse externs administered a nasal swab that is quick and painless. The swab specimens were sent to a lab at the UMB Medical School for PCR (polymerase chain reaction) testing, and the results came back 24 hours later.
        
        (3) ***Contract tracing.*** Any positive diagnostic test result will be communicated immediately to the state health authorities, who will then activate a contact tracing team to identify potential secondary cases to limit spread of infection. UMD will supplement, as needed, the state-administered tracing. We have also established early contract tracing on our own campus.
        
        (4) ***Environmental monitoring.*** UMD faculty experts are developing opportunities for early detection of impending illnesses by monitoring wastewater, air and high-touch surfaces in campus buildings. This early warning system can identify areas of concern to help prevent additional outbreaks.
        
        (5) ***Behavioral changes.*** There will be a campus-wide health information campaign to promote critical healthy behaviors: wear face covering at all times when in proximity to others; stay 6 feet apart from others; frequent handwashing; and stay home and rest, if sick.
        
        **Learning and teaching**  
        Provost Mary Ann Rankin is working to support faculty in creating new and engaging curricula -- blended, online, and in-person -- together with co-curricular opportunities in order to maximize student learning and development. Members of our faculty have submitted more than 150 proposals to develop courses.Work continues to determine exactly which courses will be offered in-person, online or in a blended format and what the room assignments and daily schedule will be. We expect that some portion of upper and lower division undergraduate courses will be taught in-person with priority given to classes that particularly need in-person instruction to be maximally effective such as labs, performance courses, senior capstone projects, clinical instruction and internships. Because 6 feet of physical distancing limits the number of students that can be accommodated in a classroom, it is likely that most courses with 50 or more students will be at least partially online, while low-enrollment classes such as graduate and upper-division seminars will be good candidates for in-person instruction.Faculty are also in workshops on personalizing and enriching the learning experience of students, regardless of the modality of course delivery. These changes, born of necessity, could end up transforming learning and teaching at UMD long after the pandemic is over.Additional information should be available online by mid-July. Summer Session I and II instruction is being delivered remotely. We will begin the fall semester on August 31, 2020 as scheduled. Faculty are also preparing contingency plans to move entirely to online instruction after Thanksgiving break, should there be a resurgence of the pandemic in late fall.
        
        **Research**  
        Under the leadership of Laurie Locascio, VP for Research for both UMD and UMB, our large research enterprise that employs thousands of research support staff, will re-open in several phases. Currently in Phase 1 (“limited presence”), only about 25% of all researchers are back in their campus labs. In Phase 2 (“intermediate presence”), proposed to start in September 2020, about 50% of the researchers will return. In Phase 3 (“full resumption”), proposed to start in January 2021, 75% of the researchers will be back on campus.
        
        **Student life: housing, dining, co-curricular activities, mental health and wellness**  
        A residential experience is an important component of the collegiate experience. VP for Student Affairs Patty Perillo and her team worked closely with public health experts and with Prince George's County and College Park officials on the housing plan.There are 8,900 bed spaces in University residence halls. To de-densify, triples and quad units are converted to doubles, and floor lounges are made into single or double rooms to minimize the opportunities for larger gatherings. The approved plan is to offer University housing to more than 75% of all the students who applied for housing, including all first year students. This plan also sets aside residential spaces for isolation and quarantining, if needed. Extensive procedures are also being implemented for the safety and health of Resident Life staff, housekeeping staff, and facilities staff who work in the residence halls.Dining halls will open with reduced seating capacity, carry-out options, and physical distancing. Stamp Student Union, Eppley Recreation Center, and other community gathering places will reopen with appropriate health and safety measures in place. Co-curricular programming will emphasize outdoor and virtual activities. Once the fall semester begins, the University Health Center and the Counseling Center will be open for both in person medical assistance and counseling, as well as online options for support.
        
        **Intercollegiate Athletics**  
        The Athletics Department has a comprehensive plan to safely return to training, practice, competition, and work that complies with public health guidelines as well as NCAA and Big Ten Conference requirements.Last week, football student-athletes were tested for COVID-19. They will undergo a complete physical examination and undertake daily monitoring of temperature and symptoms. Only individual training is permitted, on a voluntary basis, with physical distancing. Pending guidance from health officials, the extent of permissible training activities will be expanded gradually.Whether athletic teams can resume competition this fall, and under what conditions, is unknown at this time, pending decisions by the NCAA and the athletic conferences.
        
        **Human Resources**  
        To de-densify the campus and ensure physical distancing, the gradual return to campus of faculty and staff will be phased over several months. Remote work, alternating days for in-person staffing, and staggered arrivals/departures will be part of the gradual re-opening.Requirements for returning to work on campus can be found in a video at: [**return.umd.edu**](https://maestro.listserv.umd.edu/trk/click?ref=zvb24p867_2-2304x326c1x08867&). Please note that the video contains a "UMD COVID-19 Community Responsibility Pledge." In the spirit of solidarity, it is imperative that we share the responsibility for the safety and health of other members of our community.A similar pledge and COVID-19 training will be prepared and given to students when they arrive on campus.
        
        **Fiscal Planning**  
        The University is working with USM, and USM is working with the State, on the enormous budget impacts of COVID-19. At this time, the State's Department of Budget and Management has not yet released its proposed budget. We anticipate that there will be budget reductions, but we do not yet know their magnitude. We expect that furloughs or temporary salary reductions will have to be implemented, and we will share additional details as soon as we receive the proposed state budget.In conclusion, to the scores of faculty, staff, and students who have worked tirelessly in helping develop the framework and plans for the safe and gradual re-opening of the University, starting in fall 2020, I want to say THANK YOU! Because of your work, I am confident that we will re-open the campus safely, and that our State's flagship university will emerge from this trying time as an even stronger institution.Please submit questions to [communityfeedback@umd.edu](mailto:ommunityfeedback@umd.edu) and your question will be directed to the appropriate campus unit.
        
        May you all stay safe and be well.

        <h2 id=Text>Content of the post</h2> i'm a current freshman and had a pretty good registration date for courses last semester (for this semester) and was able to get all the classes i wanted, but for this fall semester, i have a april 29th registration date. does anyone know what the likelihood is for me being able to get the classes i want with this date? most of my other freshman friends have registration dates on april 25 but have the same amount of credits as me, so i'm not sure what exactly happened (maybe i just got unlucky)

        <br>Top Upvoted Comment 1: How many credits do you have? Looks like you're still ahead of most freshmen since all the sophomores I know have registration around April 30th or May 1st. It doesn't factor in credits from the current semester, so I had 34 before this semester and got May 1st.

        <br>Top Upvoted Comment 2: It depends on the classes you're registering for. I always had an early registration date compared to peers, but I still had a hard time getting classes I wanted. For example, I was a sophomore registering for junior and senior classes last year and had a difficult time getting classes I needed, since they register significantly earlier (I am a junior and registered March 28th this semester). Best you can do is hop on waitlists and pray if you're trying to get upper level classes

        <h2 id=Title>Title: Taking courses outside</h2>
        <h2 id=Text>Content of the post</h2> So I am currently an EE/CS double major. I just got a revised 4 year plan from my counselor and am graduating Spring 2026. She was very generous and kept me at 14-16 credits every sem which will slow progress. I do plan on taking summer courses (also left out) along with at least 16 maybe 18 if planned well per sem. 
        
        I’m wondering does UMD usually allow u to take ENEE courses at another institution. I’ve seen a lot that transfer over (unlike CS which is required to be taken at Iribe). Please lmk

        Also, you’ll need to ask for permission to take course outside of UMD after a certain amount of credits. Community college is your best bet. I think after like 60 credits or something along those lines.

        1) I am trying to get the gateway reqs done as quick as possible, so how does picking courses work?
        
        2) I also have received a guaranteed transfer to BU next september. So would trying my absolute hardest to get into CE and if it doesnt work out, go to BU be a smart decision?
        
        Any feedback and help is greatly appreciated thanks!!!

        <br>Top Upvoted Comment 2: I know this is not what you're asking but the counter-culture thought is why not select Gen Eds based on what offer you most opportunity to complement possible major selections and discover new passions? Later you can make more informed decisions about suitability of one or another upper level sequence, and maybe will have knocked some pre-reqs out of the way. I know it is a weird idea - get actual value from stuff we take ay college - but I once heard that is why we are here.

        These classes have absolutely no overlap with each other. On top of this, you only need 2 SCIS and 2 DVUP.
        
        You can pair them up (or triple them up) with the dshs, dssp, and dshu triplet. It’ll only be inefficient if you are in a situation where you have to take a dvup or scis solo class. Avoid this at all cost.

After I completed community college, I found out that only my general education classes transferred over and none of my CS classes did. Hearing this news was devastating, but also partially my fault for not double checking the transfer requirements. This was one of my first setbacks because I knew that if I wanted to graduate in two years like my initial plan, I knew I would have to take classes every single semester (fall, winter, spring, summer).
        
        As a transfer it was hard adjusting to the new college dynamic. Even though I had friends that already went here. It was harder to make friends and join existing friend groups since most people had established friend groups since freshman year. Since I had all my gen eds transfer, I had a lot of space in my schedule and wanted to try out different classes that seemed interesting. This however, backfired. Taking the classes that I found interesting ended up being time consuming and challenging which ultimately made my grades suffer. 
        
        While at community college, the classes I took didn’t require as much effort as they did at UMD. During my first year I didn’t realize how much effort and time I had to put into my classes (major and electives). After my second semester I noticed my GPA was dipping and I was getting concerned about my grades. I decided to go visit an advisor to see what I could do about my grades. This wasn’t very helpful to me because rather than telling me that it was best to withdraw (which I didn’t know was a thing at the time), I should try to pass the class. This caused my GPA to drop below a 2.0 because I could not keep up with the course work. So, I was put on academic probation.
        
        Knowing I was on academic probation, I knew I had to do everything possible to bring my GPA above a 2.0. Unfortunately, it was one of my heaviest course loads having to take CMSC216, CMSC250, and MATH240 (alongside a few extra credits to bring up my GPA). I attended office hours every day and joined a study group to help keep me motivated during the semester. Unfortunately, I fell short and failed CMSC216 which caused me to be put on academic dismissal. 
        
        During Winter 2020 I learned about my academic dismissal and tried contacting advisors more information but received little to no information causing me to feel more depressed and helpless. I wasn’t sure on what to do anymore or who to contact for help. All of this caused me to feel the lowest I ever felt, I could hardly leave my room most days and completely shut myself off from everyone. As a first gen Asian male there is this stigma where failure isn’t really an option. So, it took me months to tell my parents about being kicked out of college. Although, my parents were disappointed in me they still encouraged me to finish my degree. 
        
        During my gap year of Spring 2020 I looked into the different ways I could reapply to UMD. Over the summer I decided to apply to reinstate. After waiting for two months and countless emails I finally got my acceptance. After receiving this I knew my mindset and the way I approached schoolwork had to change. I promised myself that I will graduate and not let my parents down again. I knew that I wasn’t going to graduate with my class of 2020. But I still wanted to graduate ASAP because I was the oldest and had younger siblings, so I needed to graduate to help financially support my family.
        
        My first semester back I retook CMSC216 along with a few electives to help boost my GPA. With my new mindset I was able to bring my GPA above a 2.0 and even made deans list. I found studying habits that worked best for me (see advice section). Since I was trying to graduate as soon as possible it required me to take courses every single semester including winter and summer for the next 2 years. There were times that I doubted myself and really wanted to give up. But I kept reminding myself that I needed to graduate not just for myself but for my family as well. 
        
        Fast forward to my final year, I still managed to make Dean’s list every semester and started applying for full time jobs. Since I was taking classes during the summer, I wasn’t able to get an internship to put on my resume. To make myself a competitive applicant I did side projects in my free time to build up my resume. I kept applying to jobs throughout the semester until the start of the Spring 2022. I’ve done over 50 applications and finally got my first job offer. It was good enough, so I accepted it.
        
        I managed to keep that promise to myself and made my family proud. 
        
        After 6 long years today is the day, I graduate.
        
        &#x200B;
        
        Here’s some advice I learned through these years:
        
        * Always start any assignment or project early. I forced myself to get into the habit of starting my assignments the day they’re assigned. You’ll be surprised at how much more free time you’ll have.
        * Office hours. Use it. The thing with starting assignments early office hours are empty at the beginning so you’ll pretty much have 1 on 1 with the TA’s.
        * If you’re in a class that you don’t know anyone in, be proactive and ask people in the Groupme if they’re down to make a study group. That’s how I met mine and helped me throughout the years.
        * Don’t be scared to talk to people in your class since they’re in the same boat as you. They may end up being your closest friends by the end of college.
        * Make sure to take breaks, but make sure you hold yourself accountable. An example would be I would do an assignment then give myself an hour to play video games before starting another assignment.
        * Take advantage of easy electives. If you know that you’ll have a difficult semester and you’re worried about dropping in GPA, offset it with easy electives.
        
        **TLDR**: Transferred to UMD from CC and none of my CS classes transferred. Struggled my first year and got into academic probation and fell short the next semester and got put into academic dismissal. Mental health took a toll and had to take a gap semester and changed my mindset. Applied for reinstatement and grinded for two years to graduate as soon as possible taking classes every semester including winter and summer. Graduated with a full time job offer lined up. I wish I could have told myself everything would be okay 2 years ago.

        <br>Top Upvoted Comment 1: Can I add a piece of advice of my own, besides saying congratulations to you?  You wrote that an advisor didn't tell you about withdrawing from a course, which you didn't know was a thing.  My advice is that anyone going to the school should read about the registration policies, withdraw policies, etc., because this can be really useful stuff to know.
        
        I guess my second piece of advice would be to talk with profs if you are having challenges or aren't doing well.  They can give advice, answer questions, and sometimes tell you that the best thing might be to consider dropping the course and redoing it the next semester.  Sometimes people treat teachers like strange alien beings and never talk with them, but that's what their job is to talk with students (meaning besides just give lectures).
        
        But just out of curiosity, my experience is that most teachers talk about the drop date a lot right around that time of the semester, and departments email students about it also- didn't your teachers mention the drop date, or your department say anything about it?  Of course maybe you don't remember that by now, lol.

        <h2 id=Title>Title: Counselor Opens Major Course Section for Transfer Students?</h2>
        <h2 id=Text>Content of the post</h2> I am not sure about this, but I saw in this thread that counselors have authority? to open major classes that is full to transfer students. I am transferring into UMD from Spring 2024 and I just wanted to postpone(change) my orientation date for some reason if counselor have such an authority. 
        
        I am posting this, though I can call them tomorrow, as I want to confirm asap if anyone had such experience of registering major classes that are full as a transfer student.

        <br>Top Upvoted Comment 1: Never heard of such a thing. Let us know what you find out.
        
        Seems unlikely though. Full means full. I don't see anyone other than the offering department doing such a thing. To mess with offerings/capacities one needs to know seat capacity of the room, the contracts under which instructors operate, the resources used by the class (TAs and labs in particular) and a lot more. After a unit director gets all these moving parts aligned, I don't fancy that they will be delighted to have someone they've never heard of from outside their unit has just reached in and tossed more warm bodies into the mix.

        <br>Top Upvoted Comment 2: If you're transferring, and you have a required major course that's mandatory for you to complete by a certain semester (for example, some will say "must be completed by junior year"), then an advisor MIGHT be able to get you into the course after it's already full. But the first thing to do is get yourself on the waitlist. Most courses have seats open up after the first day of class, and if you're high up on the waitlist, you'll get in.

        <br>Top Upvoted Comment 1: I know HESP202 is being offered for the whole Summer, May 28- July 5. 3 credits, online, asynchronous and an easy A. Great as a credit filler and elective

        <br>Top Downvoted Comment 1: 3 in session one and 3 in session two would be way better. The time commitment for summer classes definitely varies based on the class but two at one time would probably get super stressful and you wouldn’t have much time to do anything else (based on my own experience with summer classes)
